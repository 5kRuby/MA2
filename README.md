# MA2
Macros
--------Hello to Anyone Looking for MA2 Macros
I'm mainly a gaffer for lighting in the film production space. But I am dabeling more into MA2, as I use similar programs for film work but not as adavanced. 
These are some MA2 macros that I've been devoloping and will continue to add to.
Maybe some of these are helpful to some, maybe not. 
Feel free to adapt them to your needs.

Here is a little rundown of what each macro does.

EXEC WIDTH.xml - Expand/Contract Executor Width
  1. Select Executor Number (prompted)
  2. Select Width you'd like 1-5 (Prompted) - Make sure you have the width available to expand depending on what size you want.

EXEC BUTTON ASSIGN.xml - Assign an Executor a specific Button Assignment.
  1. Select Executor # (prompted)
  2. Secelt Type of BUTTON - Toggle/Go/Temp/Flash/Load/On? (Promted)

SEQ ASSIGN.xml - Assign a Seq you have to an Executor # or Fader.
  1.Select which sequence you'd like to Assign. (prompted)
